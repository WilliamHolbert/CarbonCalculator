# Microsoft Sustainability Project - Melton Team

This is a project for the Data Analytics capstone at Washington State University.
\
\
The goal of this project is to analyze the carbon consumption of Microsoft, with a focus on their data centers. We are analyzing their usage over time and forcasting their continued usage and how it compares to goals and initiatives they have set, like being carbon negative by 2030.

## Data
The data used here is from the [Carbon Discolsure Project](https://www.cdp.net/en/). CDP is an international organization that encourges both cities an companies to disclose their carbon emissions, climate risks and reduction targets.
